# Homie v2 MicroPython Framework

MicroPython implementation of the [Homie v2](https://github.com/marvinroger/homie) convention.

This project is in alpha stage.


## Install

For now you have to install MicroHomie by hand. We will provide PyPi packages on beta stage.

To copy MicroHomie to your device use your favorite MicroPython remote shell like [rshell](https://github.com/dhylands/rshell), [mpfshell](https://github.com/wendlers/mpfshell) or [ampy](https://github.com/adafruit/ampy).

Create a directory `homie` on your device and copy the file `__init__.py` from the `homie` directory. Then create a `node` directory in `homie` and copy `__init__.py`, `led.py`, `simple.py` from the `homie/node` directory to the device.

Your file system structure should now look similar like this:

```
├── homie
│   ├── __init__.py
│   ├── node
│   │   ├── __init__.py
│   │   ├── led.py
│   │   ├── simple.py
├── boot.py
├── main.py
```

## Configuration

MicroHomie use a `settings.py` file to configure the device. An example `settings.py` file is in the example directory. Modify this file for your needs and copy it to your device root directory.

## ESP8266 example device

In this example we use the on-board LED from the ESP8266. Copy the `example-led.py` file from the `examples` diretory to your device and rename it to `main.py`.

You can now connect a MQTT client to your MQTT Broker an listen to the `homie/#` topic, or whatever you set as base topic.

Reset your ESP8266 and watch incoming MQTT messages.

The on-board LED status is reversed to the pin status. On start the on-board
LED is on. To turn it off send 'on' or 'toggle' via MQTT. Replace `<DEVICEID>` with the ID from the MQTT topic:

```shell
$ mosquitto_pub -t 'homie/<DEVICEID>/led/power/set' -m on
$ mosquitto_pub -t 'homie/<DEVICEID>/led/power/set' -m off
$ mosquitto_pub -t 'homie/<DEVICEID>/led/power/set' -m toggle
```


## Add a node

We provide some example nodes in the `homie/node` directory. Most of these nodes can be used out of the box to publish data. If you want to use a DHT22 sensor in example, copy the files `__init__.py` and `dht22.py` from `homie/node` to the same directory on your device. In the `dht22.py` file you see an example `main.py` as docstring. Copy this example to `main.py` on your device and on next reset it starts publishing temperature and humidity. In this example the DHT22 sensor is wired to GPIO PIN 4, on ESP8266 this is PIN D2.

You have to setup/configure the network by yourself.


### Simple node

In most cases you write your own node classes. But if you just want to test publishing or have a simple use case, you can use the `SimpleHomieNode` class. The `SimpleHomieNode` does not provide all homie properties, but can be used as a fast start, when you don't want to write anything in a class:

```python
import utime

from homie.node.simple import SimpleHomieNode
from homie import HomieDevice

CONFIG = {
    'mqtt': {
        'broker': '127.0.0.1',
    },
}

homie = HomieDevice(CONFIG)

n = SimpleHomieNode(node_type=b'dummy', node_property=b'value', interval=5)
n.value = 17

homie.add_node(n)
homie.publish_properties()

while True:
    homie.publish_data()
    n.value = utime.time()
    print(n)
    utime.sleep(1)
```
